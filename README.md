# SecuroBot
A Python script to train an AI chatbot on cybersecurity topics using a neural network and reinforcement learning

## How it works

1.	Import necessary libraries: This script uses a variety of libraries to facilitate its functions. These include TensorFlow for machine learning, Keras for neural networks, Gym for reinforcement learning, NumPy for array manipulation, and Pandas for data handling.

2.	Define a function to create the chatbot model: The create_model function creates the structure of our chatbot - a neural network. This network is built in layers, including an Embedding layer that transforms words into numerical vectors, an LSTM layer (Long Short Term Memory) which helps the network understand the context of a conversation over time, and a Dense layer that makes the final decision on what the chatbot should say.

3.	Define a function to preprocess text: The preprocess_text function transforms the text data into a format that the model can understand and learn from. It uses a Keras’ Tokenizer to convert words into numerical representations (tokenization), and pad_sequences to ensure all input sequences have the same length.

4.	The main function: This function loads cybersecurity related dialogues and labels from a given data source. Then, it preprocesses these dialogues using the function we described above. After that, it creates the chatbot model with the create_model function.

5.	Splitting the data: The data is then divided into training and testing datasets. The training set is used to teach the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate how well the model has learned.

6.	Train the model: The chatbot model is then trained using the training dataset. This is where the chatbot learns from the dialogues about cybersecurity. It tries to understand the context, the meaning of different words, and how they are used in different situations.

7.	Save the model: After training, the model is saved as a .h5 file. This file represents the trained chatbot and can be loaded later to make predictions or continue training.

In a nutshell, this script is about creating a chatbot that can understand and participate in cybersecurity-related conversations. It does this by learning from a dataset of cybersecurity dialogues and their associated labels. The model it creates can be saved and used later for cybersecurity discussions.

## In simpler terms 

1.	Load Libraries: This script loads a bunch of software tools that do different tasks, like Google’s TensorFlow which helps to build and train artificial intelligence models, or Gym for making AI play games to learn new things.

2.	Creating the chatbot model: create_model is like the brain of the chatbot, where it’s structured to learn and understand things. It uses special layers like an LSTM, which is sort of like the chatbot’s memory. It remembers past words to understand the context of what’s being said.

3.	Preprocessing Text: The preprocess_text function cleans up the language that the chatbot will learn from. It’s like when you simplify a tough concept into easier words. This step makes sure the chatbot understands what it’s learning.

4.	Main function: This part of the script grabs the cybersecurity conversations from somewhere and gets them ready for the chatbot to learn from. Then, it uses create_model to create the chatbot’s brain.

5.	Splitting the Data: Just like in school, the chatbot has a “study phase” and a “test phase”. The cybersecurity conversations are split into a part for learning (training) and a part for testing how well it learned.

6.	Train the model: The chatbot now studies the training data. This is when it’s learning all about cybersecurity. It’s trying to understand the words and how they’re used in different situations.

7.	Save the model: After the chatbot has finished studying, we save its brain as a .h5 file. This way, we can use it later to chat about cybersecurity without having to learn everything again.

In simple words, this script is teaching a chatbot to talk and understand cybersecurity. It’s like a tutor, giving the chatbot lessons, then testing it, and finally saving what it learned for later.

## Notes & Requirements

To use this script, users need to have:

1. **Python**: The script is written in Python, so it needs to be installed on your system. Python 3.6 or newer is recommended.

2. **Python Libraries**: You need several Python libraries installed. These include TensorFlow for creating the neural network, Keras for constructing the AI model, NumPy for handling numerical data, BeautifulSoup and Requests for web scraping, NLTK for natural language processing, and gym for the reinforcement learning.

3. **Data Source**: For the chatbot to learn from, you'll need a source of dialogues related to cybersecurity. These could be chat logs, forum threads, or any other large corpus of relevant text.

4. **Computing Resources**: Training AI models can be resource-intensive. A modern computer with a decent CPU and RAM is needed. A GPU is not strictly necessary but can greatly speed up training.

5. **Basic Python Knowledge**: While not a strict requirement, a basic understanding of Python and general programming principles would be very useful for understanding and modifying the script.

6. **Internet Connection**: As the script has a functionality to scrape data from the web, an active internet connection is required.

7. **please make sure** that your data source files “your_data_source.csv” and “your_labels_source.csv” are correctly provided and contain the required data.
The two are set as placeholders for
ease of customization.
